                    <p>Thanks for checking out my website and my very first blog post! I'm hoping to post here somewhat frequently, perhaps semi-monthly. As I'm writing this, I'm just about done with winter break and nearly finished with the first iteration of this website which I'm coding from scratch.
                        It's been my first real time coding HTML and CSS, which I can tell will come in handy down the line.

                        <br><br>My break was mostly very relaxing, and my family welcomed a new beagle puppy named Paisley into our home in December! She's the first real pet we've had since I was very little and has been absolutely amazing. Her state of being rotates between play, sleep, and beg for human food.
                        I also got to sink my teeth into a new video game, <em><a href="omori-game.com/">Omori</a></em> by OMOCAT. It spent six years in development and I've been waiting for it since middle school -- it was definitely worth the long dev time. Very RPG-like with a compelling story and a mix of cutesy/horror elements and beautiful music and art.
                        I'm calling it now, this game is gonna explode in popularity when it hits consoles.
